      <h1>    In Depth Risk Analysis</h1>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I am writing to yon today regarding the Samma Senior Apartments that we are currently pursing. The Owner has an anticipated start date of June 1st, 2022.</p>
      <p>In our efforts prepare our proposal for submission, we have identified some risks surrounding the Samma Senior Apt. that we would like to highlight moving forward. For The Persimmon Tree Construction to have a successful project, these items below need to be addressed to mitigate any risk of impact to the schedule or estimate.</p>
      <p>The Persimmon Tree Construction stop five risks for The Samma Senior Apt.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·        Labor Availability/Quality</p>
      <p>·        Incomplete Specs/Drawings</p>
      <p>·        Availability of materials</p>
      <p>·        Supplier Delays</p>
      <p>·        Proximity of Sammamish River &amp; Environmental Habitat for Species</p>
      <p>‍</p>
      <h2>Labor Availability/Quality</h2>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>The Persimmon Tree Construction will be self-performing the full Divisions 03,05,08, and 10.To produce a quality product within budget, The Persimmon Tree will need to find and build an experienced team to complete these scopes of work, and goodworkers are hard to find. This risk element is associated with the requirements that we must self-perform these divisions.</p>
      <p>There is considerable risk for The persimmon Tree to find enough quality labor to staff this project. Labor is the number one risk on a project.</p>
      <p>To mitigate these risks, we have proposed these mitigation measures.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·        Selective Hiring</p>
      <p>·        Supervisory Training</p>
      <p>·        Specialty Training</p>
      <p>·        Potentially subcontract out work (Ex: Rebar supply/placing)</p>
      <p>·        Potentially Implement QA/QC personnel</p>
      <p>If the Persimmon Tree were to continue pursuing this project, labor availability and quality will be a concern, but implementing the mitigation measures above will help reduce the risk.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we have proposed that staffing a Lead Foreman during the duration of the self- performed work will help mitigate the labor concern. The benefits of having a lead Foreman for</p>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>this project is that they will specifically focus on the self-performed work while the General Supt. will focus on operations of the entire project.</p>
      <h2>Incomplete Specs/Drawings (Documents)</h2>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>The current set of Specs and Drawings that we have been working off are the 100% Bid Documents10.15.22. Our team have analyzed the documents and found that missing details and drawings are missing from the sets. Please see below for a couple.</p>
      <p>·        The Drawings nor Specs indicate Demolition oft the existing (1) story building on the property</p>
      <p>·        Missing concrete details for elevator pits &amp;retaining/planter walls To mitigate these risks, we have proposed these mitigation measures.</p>
      <p>·        Accept awarded project with a contingency</p>
      <p>·        Implement a plan &amp; control program</p>
      <p>·        Change control</p>
      <p>·        Preconstruction Service</p>
      <p>·        Thoroughly check plans for errors</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>If the Persimmon Tree were to continue pursuing this project, we would highly recommend the owner to bring us on for preconstruction services. Our team can help coordinate and fill any missing items, so when the project breaks ground, it does not have any holdups or issues.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the100% Bid Specs state there will be no contingency for the project. We will encourage the owner to set money aside for this.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>If preconstruction is not an option, our team must be prepared to encounter any scope/design changes during the construction phase. We are confident that if we implement a plan &amp; control program, and change control system, our team will be able to stay organized and efficient on keeping the project moving along. These plans will be further discussed in depth a later time but will require additional coordination with the Architect/Engineers.</p>
      <h2>Availability of Materials</h2>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>As of now, material/equipment prices are still much higher than pre pandemic cost, and the availability of materials/equipment are low. All scopes work are affected by long lead times and this constraint is a substantial impact for the construction industry. The availability of materials/equipment&#x27;s a significant risk concern for construction. The potential consequences related to this concern are schedule delays, increased costs, and design/product changes during construction.</p>
      <p>To mitigate these risks, we have proposed these mitigation measures.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·        Early procurement</p>
      <p>·        Off-site storage</p>
      <p>·        Special management emphasis on long lead items</p>
      <p>·        Alternate products list</p>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>The whole construction industry is affected by the availability of materials/equipment. Our company has found that now adays it is a norm to procure items early and schedule/plan around the long lead items. If the Persimmon Tree were to continue pursuing this project, we would highly recommend bringing on subcontractors immediately to procure materials/equipment early. The additional planning that we can perform after acceptance and before breaking ground will save days in the construction schedule.</p>
      <h2>Labor Disputes, Strikes</h2>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>Ex: Teamsters Local 174 –Concrete Strike update:</p>
      <p>·        Delivery drivers have returned to work</p>
      <p>·        Unconditional end to a strike with no deal struck</p>
      <p>·        Months of backlog</p>
      <p>·        ~$200 surcharge per CY for those who wanted conc. during strike To mitigate these risks, we have proposed these mitigation measures.</p>
      <p>·        Plan &amp; control program</p>
      <p>·        Emergency/backup plan</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Persimmon Tree Construction is not signatory to the Unions. Union strikes and Labor disputes do affect the construction industry as a whole and it is still our concern to be aware of any labor disputes or union strikes. Using the most recent union strike in the greater Seattle area, the Teamsters Local 174 Strike affected every project because concrete could not get to the jobsites. Jobsites were paying expensive surcharges for concrete and project schedules were delayed. Strikes can be a huge risk for contractors and there is no way of telling how long they can last. While The Persimmon Tree cannot do much to prevent a strike or labor disputes between unions, we can plan and think of backup plans if anything happens. An example backup plan that we have used during the recent concrete strike was obtaining two approved concrete mix designs. Concrete was supplied at one facility, but was then picketed, not allowing trucks to get out. With the second mix design, the project was able to go to another supplier the same day and get concrete per the approved second mix design without any picketing distributions.</p>
      <h2>Proximity to Sammamish River</h2>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>The Samma Senior Apartments is approximately 250’-300’ from the Sammamish River. Construction isa loud and busy operation at times and a risk for this project is its proximity to the Sammamish River and construction operations may cause a jobsite shutdown if it does not follow strict environmental guidelines.</p>
      <p>To mitigate the risk, we have proposed these mitigation measures.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·        Follow TESC plans</p>
      <p>·        Review and implement recommendations from GeoTech report</p>
      <p>·        Review and implement recommendations from Environmental report</p>
      <p>·        Perform and log SWPPP reports</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To reduce any project shutdowns, The Persimmon Tree must implement all the following mitigation measures and have monthly meetings with the AHJ/consultants to protect the Sammamish River form any construction disturbance. The Persimmon Tree will follow all guidelines required to protect the Sammamish River.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Eui Jeong, Conner Chan</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Project Manager, Superintendent</p>
